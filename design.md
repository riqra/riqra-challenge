At Riqra, we use Figma as our main design tool. We would like you to redesign this section of our administration panel where a customer can upload multiple banners to communicate with their buyers.

Feel free to add, remove or modify elements if you think it’s necessary. You’re also free to choose the main platform for which you’ll design your solution around (mobile, desktop or both).

The deliverable of this exercise should be anything you deem enough to help us understand the process of your proposal from beginning to end.

At the end of the process you will have a video call with us where you’ll explain your process and end product.

We will evaluate the following aspects:

- Ability to establish a process
- Understanding of basic interaction and design principles
- Ability to give and receive feedback
- Good practices in project handoff
- Components composition (atomic design)
- Design system fundamentals
